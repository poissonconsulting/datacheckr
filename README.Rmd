This README is the outline for a possible an R package 
to check the names, classes and values of
columns in objects inheriting from class data.frame.

## The Problem

Most of the packages I write need to check that one or more user supplied data frames
have the correct type of data in them before proceeding to analysis or plotting. 
If they don't the packages need to provide a helpful
error message so the user is able to correct the input data. To the best of
my knowledge an elegant solution to this problem does not currently exist.
If you think it does please let me know right away <joe@poissonconsulting.ca>.

## A Solution?

I need a function that is able to input a data frame and test whether or not
it includes certain named columns of particular classes that may or may not
contain particular values including missing values. If not it should return
an informative error message if so it should return the original data frame
so it is able to be used in piping sequences.

It seems to me that a function that takes the input data frame and 
a named list of vectors specifying the possible values would fit the bill.
Let us call it `deck`. The names of the list elements would specify
those columns that need to appear in the data.frame while the classes
of the vectors would specify the classes of the column.

Thus, to specify that x should contain a column called `col1` of class integer
the call would be one of the following because with a single value only
its class matters.
```
deck(x, list("col1" = 1L))
deck(x, list("col1" = 2L))
```

To specify that x should not contain a column called `col1`
the call is just
```
deck(x, list("col1" = NULL))
```
and to specify that it can contain a column `col1` that can
be integer or numeric values the call would be
```
deck(x, list("col1" = 3L, "col1" = NULL, "col1" = 9))
```
To specify that a column can include missing values just
add an `NA` to the vector.
```
deck(x, list("col1" = c(1L, NA)))
```
And to indicate that it must fall within a range use
two non-missing values (the following code tests for counts).
```
deck(x, list("col1" = c(0L, .Machine$integer.max)))
```
If particular values are required then specify them
as vector of three or more missing values
```
deck(x, list("col1" = c(0L, 1L, 4L)))
```
The above code test that `col1` contains just the counts 0, 1 and 4.

Missing values, ranges and particular values work identically 
for numeric, and Date vectors while for logical values two and 
three or more non-missing values behave identically, i.e.,
use `deck(x, list("col1" = c(TRUE, TRUE)))` to indicate only
`TRUE` values.

To specify that `col1` must be a character vector use
```
deck(x, list("col1" = "b"))
```
while the following requires that the values match both
character elements which are treated as regular expressions
```
deck(x, list("col1" = c("^//d", ".*")))
```
with three or more non-missing character elements
each value in `col1` must match at least one.



The behaviour of `deck` should be independent of the
order of the list elements (or the vector elements for that matter).




The following call says `x` must have a `col1` 
that is a integer or numeric and `col2` that is a Date and no columns
called `col3`.
```
deck(x, list("col1" = 3L, "col1" = NULL, "col1" = 9))
```
